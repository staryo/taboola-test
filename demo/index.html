    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
    give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
    master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but
    because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
    Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
    occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
    example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
    has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
    avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
    dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that
    they cannot foresee
